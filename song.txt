I have your arms around me
Warm like fire
But when I open my eyes
You're gone
I'm a big, big girl
In a big, big world
It's not a big, big thing
If you leave me
But I do, do feel
That I do, do will
Miss you much
Miss you much
I'm a big, big girl
In a big, big world
It's not a big, big thing
If you leave me
But I do feel I will
Miss you much
Miss you much
